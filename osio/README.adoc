This give details on https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-oso-proxy/[fabric8-services/fabric8-oso-proxy] project which is forked from https://github.com/containous/traefik[containous/traefik] project.

== Overview

OSO Proxy project is proxy between OSIO (OpenShift.io) and OSO (OpenShift Online server / OpneShift server).  It takes care of replacing OSIO Token (user token) with OSO Token.  Ideally, all calls from OSIO to OSO should go through oso-proxy but currently there are some exception due to some well known reason.

OSO Proxy is forked from Traefik project.  Ideally, oso-proxy should have used Traefik as dependency and should not forked from Traefik but currently Traefik does not provide mechanism to plugin 3rd party extensions, so, oso-proxy is forked from Traefik and OSIO extensions were added directly into Traefik codebase.

== OSO Proxy code

This section list down all the code that is added in Traefik for OSO Proxy.

== OSIO and Traefik

There are mainly two components added in traefik for OSIO in OSO Proxy project.

=== Traefik Provider

Traefik docs link: https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#frontends[frontends], https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#backends[backends]

Traefik configuratin has two main elements called "frontends and backends" which provides details on routing/redirecting to traefik.  These configuations can be provided in multiple way to traefik.  For OSIO, we have implmentation "OSIO Traefik Provider" to provide these configuration details to traefik.

OSIO provider https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-oso-proxy/blob/master/provider/osio/osio.go[code_link] implements Provider inerface from Traefik https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-oso-proxy/blob/master/provider/provider.go[code_link] and registered at https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-oso-proxy/blob/master/configuration/configuration.go[code_link].

Here is basic sequence flow which shows OSIO Traefik provider operations:

=== Traefik Middleware

This is a regular Go Middleware.  Each http request comes to traefik, it will call all middleware in sequence addded in https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-oso-proxy/blob/master/server/server.go[server.go].  There is a OSIO Traefik middleware added in server.go.  Please check, *Server* struct with *osioMiddleware* field having type **osio.OSIOAuth*.

OSIO Traefik middleware mainly does two things.  First, it replaces OSIO User Token with OSO User token in http request.  Second, it sets traefik https://docs.traefik.io/basics/#matchers[Matchers] "Headers" with "Target" as key and "OSO Cluster URL" as value.  With help of "Target", traefik will redirect call to corresponding OSO Server.
